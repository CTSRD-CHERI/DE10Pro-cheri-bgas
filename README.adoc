The https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/DE10Pro-cheri-bgas[DE10Pro-cheri-bgas]
repository to provides FPGA bitfiles for the CHERI-BGAS project.

It includes the Stratix 10 Quartus project, IP configuration, toplevel entity
verilog, and signal tap configuration files, necessary for synthesis of a
configuration image for the Terasic DE10Pro SX board.
At the moment, the project uses Quartus 23.2pro.

This repository also includes RTL sources under the
https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/DE10Pro-cheri-bgas/tree/main/bluespec[bluespec/]
folder, where various git submodules are used and suplemented with a few `.bsv`
files providing some "toplevel glue" as well as a minimal simulation
framework.

=== Build dependencies

Building the `vipbundle` tool requires a working installation of the `ghc`
haskell compiler with the `regex-tdfa` haskell library. It will be built
automatically as part of the overall build process for the FPGA image.

Additionally, you will need a working installation of
https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/programmable/downloads/download-center.html[Quartus 23.2pro]
and a https://github.com/B-Lang-org/bsc[bluespec compiler].

==== Building in Docker (optional)

To deal with dependencies, you can also run in Docker.  For this you will need
an existing Quartus Pro 23.2 installation, which will be passed through to
your Docker container.

First, ensure your `QUARTUS_ROOTDIR` and `LM_LICENSE_FILE` variables are set
as appropriate for your installation:

[source, shell]
----
$ export QUARTUS_ROOTDIR=/opt/intelfpga/23.2pro/quartus
$ export LM_LICENSE_FILE=27001@lmserv-intelfpga.example.com
----

Now build the Docker environment (takes some time as it installs GHC and
builds BSC):

[source, shell]
----
$ make build-docker
----

and then launch a shell inside it:

[source, shell]
----
$ make shell
----

=== Build a Stratix 10 bitfile

To generate a bitfile you can run:

[source, shell]
----
$ make synthesize
----

to generate a `output_files/DE10Pro-cheri-bgas.sof` Stratix 10 FPGA bitfile.

==== Generate `.rbf` bitfile slices and embed a bootloader

The bitfiles generated embed both a soft RISCV core and an ARM Hard Processor
System (HPS). The bootloader code for the HPS can be embedded into a bitfile.
To do so, you can run

[source, shell]
----
$ BOOTLOADER=some/bootloader/ihex make gen-rbf
----
or simply
[source, shell]
----
$ make gen-rbf
----

once an FPGA bitfile has been successfully generated.
This will generate two `.rbf` slices out of the `.sof`, one for the base
`hps` system configuration, and one  `core` configuration.
The `BOOTLOADER` environment variable defaults to
`$(CURDIR)/software/uboot_build/u-boot-socfpga/spl/u-boot-spl-dtb.ihex`.

== Intel Stratix 10 Hard Processor System interactions

Software running on the HPS can interact with the RISCV system on the FPGA in a
variety of ways.  The HPS can use a "lightweight" 32-bit AXI4 port as well as a
128-bit AXI4 port to perform FPGA accesses.
https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/programmable/hps/stratix-10/hps.html[As
documented by Intel], several windows in the HPS's address space can be used to
perform these accesses:

  `0x20_6000_0000 -> 0x20_ffff_ffff`

Additionally, the RISCV system is provided a window into the HPS system's memory
map via adedicated 128-bit fpga2hps AXI4 slave port.

=== lwsoc2fpga "lightweight" AXI4 master port

The 32-bit lwsoc2fpga "lightweight" AXI4 master port is used for accesses in the
`0xf900_0000` to `0xf91f_ffff` range. Exposed through these addresses on the
FPGA side in the RISCV system are the following:

- `0xf900_0000 -> 0xf900_0fff`: Debug Unit
- `0xf900_1000 -> 0xf900_1fff`: Interrupt lines
- `0xf900_2000 -> 0xf900_2fff`: Others (not yet clear what exactly...)
- `0xf900_3000 -> 0xf900_3fff`: "fake" 16550
- `0xf900_4000 -> 0xf900_4fff`: h2f address controller

=== soc2fpga AXI4 master port

The 128-bit soc2fpga AXI4 master port is used for accesses in the ranges
documented above. It is a 32-bit address port which exposes a 4GB wide window
into the same 64-bit address memory map perceived by the RISCV core on the
FPGA. The device exposed via the lwsoc2fpga port at `0xf900_4000 ->
0xf900_4fff` allows software on the FPGA to specify the upper 32 bits of a full
64-bit address and effectively slide the available 4GB window.

=== fpga2hps AXI4 slave port

The 128-bit fpga2hps AXI4 slave port provides the RISCV softcore system with
cache-coherent access to the HPS memory map. See the
https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/programmable/us/en/pdfs/literature/hb/stratix-10/s10_5v4.pdf[Intel Stratix 10 Hard Processor System Technical Reference Manual]
