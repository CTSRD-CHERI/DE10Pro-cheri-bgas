= DmaWindow

An interface and implementations of an access window, which takes in a "target" AXI subordinate interface and exposes

* an AXI4Lite subordinate accepting writes to a "window" register
* an AXI4 subordinate which takes requests, offsets them through the window, and pumps them through the passed-in subordinate interface 

// producing equivalent requests from the input inside that window

The exact form of the window is implementation-defined -- the most basic window is just an address offset, which the DE10 uses by default.
